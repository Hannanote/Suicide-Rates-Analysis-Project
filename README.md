##  Global Suicide Rate Analysis Project

The suicide rates of various countries around the world between the years 1985 to 2016. Our visualizations aim to show the relationship between suicide rates and various factors that contribute to suicide, such as age, income rates, generational groups, and potentially climate and weather. We also plan to highlight the countries with the highest suicide rates.  Since suicide is a very sensitive topic and issue that has plagued society, visualizing general trends can lead to answers of suicide prevention. 

The dataset contains 27,820 observations: 
1. Country: 101 countries
2. Year: 1985-2016
3. Sex: Male, Female
4. Age: Categorized into 6 groups ('5-14', '15-24', '25-34', '35-54', '55-74', '75+')
5. Suicide Rate per 100k Population
6. GDP per Capita
7. Generation: G.I Generation is from 1901 – 1927;
               Silent Generation is from 1928 – 1945;
               Boomer Generation is from 1946 – 1964;
               X Generation is from 1965 – 1980;
               Millennials Generation is from 1981 – 1996;
               and Z Generation is from 1997 – 2012.

### Exploratory Analysis

- [X] Global Average Suicide Rate by year (per 100K population) <br>
In 1995, the global suicide rate peaked at 15.3 deaths per 100,000 people. Over the next two devades, this rate steadily declinced, reaching 11.5 per 100,000 by 2015, marking a significant decrease of approximately 25%. However, recent trends suggest that suicide rates are now returning to levels observed before 1990s. Due to limited data from the 1980s, it remains difficult to determine whether the rates from that period were truly representative of the global population, complicating long-term trend analysis.

- [] Sex and Age Group
   
In Tableau, six 10x10 waffle charts shows suicide rate ratios by sex and age group, with blue representing males and pink for females. Each chart uses circles (1% each) to indicate the ratio, with annotations for clarity. A stacked bar graph further illustrates average suicide rates by sex and age. The data shows consistently higher suicide rates for males, peaking 81.45% in the 25-34 age group, while females have higher rates in the over 75 group, potentially due to longer life expectancy.

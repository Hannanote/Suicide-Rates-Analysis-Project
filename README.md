###  Suicide Rate Analysis Project

the suicide rates of various countries around the world between the years 1985 to 2016. Our visualizations aim to show the relationship between suicide rates and various factors that contribute to suicide, such as age, income rates, generational groups, and potentially climate and weather. We also plan to highlight the countries with the highest suicide rates.
